# Admin Dashboard with Dry Scss

A modern minimalist admin dashboard made with Angular with Dry SCSS approach without using any CSS framework. The design is created by [Anton Avilov](https://dribbble.com/avilov), he is an absolutely amazing designer. All the rights to the design belongs to him and I am just a curious person who wants to showcase skills using his designs. You should definitely check out his dribbble profile.

DRY Scss is an approach to writing styles aimed with reducing the number of repitition. We all know CSS can really be a mess if not handled correctly. I will make use of SCSS mixins, variables, functions, etc. to keep the stylesheets as dry as possible.

Plus, I have made a bold choice of not using any CSS framework with this project. As I really want to test my skills. If you notice any bug or have any suggestion. I would be really happy to know about it. 

Wish me luck !!
